# Automatically place your workloads in an optimal location to minimize latency.
# If you are running back-end logic in a Pages Function, running it closer to your back-end infrastructure
# rather than the end user may result in better performance.

# Variable bindings. These are arbitrary, plaintext strings (similar to environment variables)

# Bind the Workers AI model catalog. Run machine learning models, powered by serverless GPUs, on Cloudflare's global network
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#workers-ai
# [ai]

# Bind a D1 database. D1 is Cloudflare's native serverless SQL database.

# Bind a KV Namespace. Use KV as persistent storage for small key-value pairs.

# KV Example:
# [[kv_namespaces]]
# binding = "MY_KV_NAMESPACE"

# Bind a Queue producer. Use this binding to schedule an arbitrary task that may be processed later by a Queue consumer.

# [[services]]
# binding = "MY_SERVICE"

# To use different bindings for preview and production environments, follow the examples below.
# When using environment-specific overrides for bindings, ALL bindings must be specified on a per-environment basis.
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/wrangler-configuration#environment-specific-overrides

######## PREVIEW environment config ########

# [env.preview.vars]
# API_KEY = "xyz789"

# [[env.preview.kv_namespaces]]
# binding = "MY_KV_NAMESPACE"
# id = "<PREVIEW_NAMESPACE_ID>"

######## PRODUCTION environment config ########


# [[env.production.kv_namespaces]]
# binding = "MY_KV_NAMESPACE"
# id = "<PRODUCTION_NAMESPACE_ID>"

# Ensure MONGODB_URL is set as a secret via `wrangler secret put MONGODB_URL`
# or through the Cloudflare dashboard.
